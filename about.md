My name is Jesse Buesking. I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/JesseBuesking), fan of [genetic programming](http://jessebuesking.com/articles/programming/2013/04/21/il-weaving-with-fody/), and I dabble in [developing libraries](https://github.com/JesseBuesking/BB.Caching) [for .net projects](https://github.com/JesseBuesking/BB.MessageFormat). I work in downtown San Francisco, California for the Analytics team at [Deem](http://www.deem.com/), but **this blog, its content and opinions are my own**. I rarely blog, but when I do the topics of focus are generally around programming, data analysis, and mathematics.

### What I do for fun

Normally you can find me programming or watching shows on Netflix - or both at the same time. Within the past year or so I've finally decided to start open sourcing and sharing projects I've worked on in my spare time. I think like most programmers I typically don't like to share my code since I doubt my own personal skill, but recently I've just stopped caring.

I really enjoy learning, so I spend a lot of my free time reading tweets, blogs, and books. I currently only read technical things, like whitepapers on various algorithms, blog posts on approaches to tackling programming challenges like scaling, or anything else that satisfies my own intellectual curiosity. As you can see, I live life on the edge.
